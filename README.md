# Atria Calendar

Event scheduling and volunteer management platform

## Environment Setup

```
cd atria-calendar
virtualenv --python=python3.6 venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install and run atria calendar

Install dependencies:

```
cd atriaapp
pip install -r requirements/demo.txt
```

Build app:

```
cd atria-calendar/atriaaapp
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata sample-data
```

Note that the last step loads some sample data from the fixture sample-data.json.

This also creates an admin user admin@mail.com with password pass1234

Run app:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/, or http://localhost:8000/admin and login as the admin user (admin@mail.com/pass1234).

## Connecting to the Sovrin Test Network (STN)

For a connection from VerityUI to the enterprise agency, (https://eas01.pps.evernym.com 4), the pool that should be connected to is the STN (Sovrin Test Network). The genesis file is in Github, but that seems to be down this morning. If you ping me in sovin slack Iâ€™ll put it in there.
